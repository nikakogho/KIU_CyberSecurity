Performing Denial of Service attack on a local computer

Setup:
I use 2 computers (A and B) on the same network.
A spins up a server.
B floods it to take it down.

We observe the status of computer A through task manager and we also try to pass a legitimate request to this server from device C on this same network to confirm that the service is indeed denied.
